 <h2>HISTORY AND ORIGIN </h2>
 <p>Cricket is a sport that is lavishly proud of its cultures, traditions, and its history. The origin of the game of cricket can be traced back many hundreds of years, and the reason why the sport became so popular is an intriguing one. As far as the name cricket is concerned there is a theory that came into existence around the time of the Norman Conquest. The story predicates that the French word ‘criquet’ was a dialect word used to describe the game of club ball. The exact origin of cricket is mysterious but it is believed to have originated in England and to have been a kid’s game in the 16th century, later taken up by adults.
In the early 18th century cricket established itself as a popular sport in London and the south-eastern counties of England. Travel restrictions hampered its expansion, but cricket was eventually gaining popularity in other regions of England, and Women’s Cricket came into the picture in 1745 when the first known cricket match was played in Surrey. In 1744, the first Laws of Cricket were written and subsequently amended in the same year itself, when new technicalities and equipment like leg before wicket, a third stump, the middle stump, and a maximum bat width were introduced. The codes were created by the “Star and Garter Club,” whose members went on to found the illustrious Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord’s in 1787. The Marylebone Cricket Club was immediately appointed as the custodian of the Laws, and revisions have been made ever since to the present date.</p>

    <h2><u><i>Laws of cricket</i></u></h2>
    <p>In cricket, the rules of the game are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"target="_blank">to know more</a> in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.[63]
        Playing area Main articles: Cricket field, Cricket pitch, Crease (cricket), and Wicket
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each.[64] The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.[65]
        In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[66] The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails</p>
